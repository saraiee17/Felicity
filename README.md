# Felicity

Felicity means happiness or the ability to find appropriate expressions for oneâ€™s thoughts. This app allows users more autonomy when it comes to their mental health. It's a website where users can track their mood and receive suggestions as well as visualize patterns and data over time through calendar and graphs.
